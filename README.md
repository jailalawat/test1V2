PART 1:

Question 1 (5 minutes time)

Write a function that takes a string as in input and outputs the string in reverse:
str = "hello"
reverse(str) => "olleh"

Question 2 (10 minutes time)

Write a function that parses following input and prints date in your local timezone:
input = "{\"time\":\"2022-06-17T05:52:39.787Z\"}"
parser(input) => "2022-06-17 07:54:13 +0200"

Question 3 (15 minutes time)

A fibonacci sequence is defined like the following
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers of the sequence are 0,1. 
Write a function that outputs the nth number in the series
For example:
fibonnaci(0) => 0
fibonnaci(1) => 1
fibonnaci(4) => 3
fibonacci(7) => 13

Your function should work for large numbers of n.
